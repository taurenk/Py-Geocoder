# PinPointGeocoder
PinPoint is a side project I have been developing. It started out as a small Python module to parse out and clean addresses - particularly ones with bad or incorrect data. The project eventually grew from an addresses parser to full scale geocoder (were not there, yet!).

The goal of PinPoint is to make a fully functioning and accurate open source geocoder built in Python, open data and, PostgreSQL.

Curently, the geocoder supports only single addresses (aka no intersections). There is a lot of work to do so please feel free to help out!
