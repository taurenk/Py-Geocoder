# PinPointGeocoder
PinPoint is a side project I have been developing. It started out as a small Python module to parse out and clean addresses - particularly ones with bad or incorrect data. The project eventually grew from an address parser to full scale geocoder - allthough, we're not there...yet!

##### I have stopped developing this version and are now working here: https://github.com/taurenk/PinPointGeocoder2
The goal of PinPoint is to make a fully functioning and accurate open source geocoder built with Python, open data and PostgreSQL.

Curently, the geocoder supports only single addresses (aka no intersections). There is a lot of work to do so please feel free to help out!
