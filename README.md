# PinPointGeocoder
PinPoint Geocoder 
PinPoint is a side project I have been working on recently. The goal is to make a fully functioning open source geocoder build in Python, running off open data.

Curently, the it supports only single addresses (aka no intersections) and there is ALOT of work to do - espically documentation!

Scrappy demo I put together: http://www.pinpointgeocoder.com/
