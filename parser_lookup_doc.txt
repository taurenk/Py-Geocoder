1. pass initial address to engine.py
1.a parse address via the address class.

2a. if a street is found, pass it to the geocoder

geocode_address strategy:
* due to the nature of the address parser, most times the city will be embeded into the 
street. Work arounds were created to solve this.
1. find zip/city candidates:
	a. if zip code, query db
	b. if city, query db
	c. if None: return error
2. if city is NOT found:
	a. break up street into tokens and compare against candidates. try to match 			potential places to the city embeded in street.
	b. if no match, use "guess city" function, which queries db for all cities in a 		state in an effort to match. Super inefficent.
		# Make a 'dev' json entry to find when this happens.
	c. if no city is found, geocode zip code #level: ZIP
3. Post Parse address
	a. look for pretype, posttype, pre-direction, post-direction
	b. standardize state
4. Find Candidates
5. Rank
6. Interpolate
